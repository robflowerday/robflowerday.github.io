    <h1>Tpyes of Machine Learning</h1>
    <p>There are three main subsets of Machine Learning. Supervised Learning, Unsupervised <br>
        Learning and Reinforcement Learning. They all try to use data to infer a <br>
        (usually benificial) outcome, prediction or action.<br>
        <br>
        The aim of Supervised and Unsupervised Learning is predict a target variable. This <br>
        could be the price of a house, the species of a plant or the price of a stock, <br>
        using feature data. This is data we already know, for example, the number of rooms <br>
        and location of a house, the petal length and height of a plant or the previous <br>
        days stock price.<br>
        <br>
        Both supervised and unsupervised learning aim to solve these and other problems by <br>
        minimising a loss function. This is a mathematical function which determines how well <br>
        the model performs. For example, the loss function for a model that predicts house <br>
        prices may be measuring the loss as the difference between the actual price and the <br>
        predicted price of the house. We will speack more about loss functions late in the <br>
        course.
    </p>
   
    <h2>Supervised Learning</h2>
    <p>Supervised Learning is used on labeled data (data for which we know the possible values <br>
        of the target variable).<br>
        <br>
        Classification models are created to solve classification problems. These models can <br>
        be called Classifiers. 'Once trained' (we'll get to that in the next lesson). <br>
        A Classifier takes unlabeled feature data as input and outputs a prediction of the <br>
        'correct' label for that data.<br>
        <br>
        There are two main types of supervised learning problems. Classification and <br>
        Regression.<br>
        <br>
        Classification problems are problems where the labeled data are discrete. This means <br>
        there is a finite amount of values the target variable can take. In program this <br>
        data is ussually represented as catagorical or boolan data types.
        <br>
        Regression problems are such that the labeled data is continuous. This means the <br>
        range of values the data can take is continous, and therefore infinite <br>
        (or may as well be). We ussually consider price data continuous as though it is <br>
        technically discrete, there is such a wide range of values that are measured in a <br>
        logical order (using the number system) that it is for practical purposes a <br>
        continuous dataset.<br>
        <br>
        2 examples of supervised learning models are:<br>
        <br>
        House Price Prediction:<br>
        <br>
        predicting the price of a house given the number of rooms it has, the city it is in <br>
        and the crime rate in the city<br>
        <br>
        The feature data here are the number of rooms in the house, the city it is in and <br>
        the crime rate in the city<br>
        <br>
        The target data here is the price of a house<br>
        <br>
        This is a Regression problem because the target data is (for all intensive purposes) <br>
        continuous.<br>
        <br>
        Spam Email Prediction:<br>
        <br>
        predicting weather an email is spam based on the email address of the sender, the <br>
        subject line, the content of the email and the time of day the email was sent.<br>
        <br>
        The feature data here is the email address of the sender, the subject line, the <br>
        content of the email and the time of day the email was sent.<br>
        <br>
        The target data is whether or not the email is spam<br>
        <br>
        This is a Classification problem because the target data is discrete, having only <br>
        two possible options (spam or not spam).
    </p>

    <h2>Unsupervised Learning</h2>
    <p>Unsupervised learning is the task of clustering data into groups based on similarities <br>
        or insights drawn from the feature data. It uses unlabed data meaning the target data <br>
        it is trying to predict (the cluster / group the data should be put into) is not <br>
        previously known.<br>
        <br>
        Though we can use supervised learning on the above problem of predicting spam email <br>
        by assuming there are two cluster and not giving the model information about whether <br>
        the emails are spam or not. Unsupervised learning models are more useful for problems 
        like the clusetering news articles by their content with similar news articles. This <br>
        can be used on news sites to recommend similar articles to the one you may be reading <br>
        without a human needing to know what each article is about (which may enatail a <br>
        laborious process of labelling the genre of each new article).
    </p>

    <h2>Reinforcement Learning</h2>
    <p>Instead of having a 'fixed' set of data to learn from, reinforcement learning uses an <br>
        agent that collects data from its environment. (an agent being an entity in an <br>
        environment like a person in a bar, the person being the agent and the bar being the 
        environment, or mario in a mario level with mario being the agent and the level being <br>
        the environment)<br>
        <br>
        The reinforcement leaning model is trying to maximize a reward function. This reward <br>
        function could for example be the score on a mario level given a vertain strategy of <br>
        playing.<br>
        <br>
        The agent interacts with the environment to gain information which it uses to inform <br>
        the agents future decisions and moves. It does this in either an exploratory, or an <br>
        explotitave manner.<br>
        <br>
        When doing so in an exploititative manner, it will choose the next decision based on <br>
        what decision it believes will give it the greatest reward.<br>
        <br>
        When acting on an exploratory manner, it acts in a sub optimal way to gain more <br>
        information about its surroundings and how they effect the reward it can gain from <br>
        any particular move, or set of moves.
    </p>

    <h2>Important Note</h2>
    <p>In this course, though I may touch on the following topics, I do not intend to <br>
        explain them here in great detail. collecting data, cleaning data and dealing with <br>
        messy data, visualising data or exploratory data analysis.<br>
        <br>
        This does not mean that they are unimportant, infact they are all of great importance. <br>
        So much so that they deserve their own course.<br>
        <br>
        I have not made a course on these yet, but until I do, many excelent courses and <br>
        tutorials can be found for there topics online.
