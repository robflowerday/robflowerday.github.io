    <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
    <p>
        My strength is in applying Machine Learning and Statistical techniques to solving real world problems. My experience with Machine Learning extends from the simple involving supervised learning techniques like KNN and decision tree models to the more complex, including convolutional and recurrent neural networks. I am currently consolidating this knowledge into my own educational website.
        I have business experience in determining, delivering, and presenting technical solutions to a range of stakeholders, both technical and non-technical, including C level colleagues. I am currently undertaking a Master’s Degree in Computer Science and Data Analytics, using my spare time to develop my understanding of Data Science through books, online courses and personal projects. 
        My undergraduate degree in Mathematics enhanced my numerical and analytical abilities and gave me a deep knowledge of statistical techniques which I am continuing to develop.
        I articulate difficult concepts concisely and, in a manner, suitable to the intended audience as demonstrated through tutoring A-Level, GCSE and University students.
        I am a lifelong learner and I put my all into everything I do.

    <h2>Employment   Horatio Investments / Pure Electric, September 2018 - February 2020</h2>
    <h3>Business Analyst</h3>
    <li>Data Analysis was a large part of this role. I identified and gathered useful data from a range of sources. I then cleaned and formatted and manipulated this data, analysing and modelling the data to produce useful solutions to business problems.</li>
    <li>I was a key player in implementing a more streamlined product range which better met the needs of our consumer and led to significant improvement in profitability.</li>
    <li>I analysed the current financial models and forecasts, in order to develop and implement a more accurate way of calculating costs to the business by realistically incorporating and predicting factors linked to costs of operation.</li>
    <li>I set up a persistent data storage solution for our sales data by connecting with the Shopify API and storing our sales data using PostgreSQL. This made the data processing pipeline more efficient and less error prone when compared with the previous method of manually updating excel sheets.</li>
    
    <h3>Head of Recruitment Selection and Analysis</h3>
    <li>Reporting directly to the CEO, I researched, designed, and developed a recruitment process tailored to identify individuals best suited to the business.</li>
    <li>I implemented psychometric and personality tests which aided the recruitment and selection process significantly. I researched numerous assessment methods including numerical and logical reasoning tests (inductive and deductive reasoning tests), interviews, case interviews used by large consultancy companies such as McKinsey job simulation interviews.</li>
    <li>I led recruitment interviews and trained colleagues to carry out these interviews</li>

    <h3></h3>
    <li>•	As acting CRM Manager, I identified the need for appropriate CRM systems in the business, to distribute email marketing and enable our customers to contact us by live chat using suitable APIs. My implementation of this simplified and improved our customer interactions driving profit by reducing churn rate and up selling to our customers.</li>
    <li>•	I developed our strategy determining which marketing channels we should use using data garner form </li>
    <li>•	Using A/B tests to collect customer data in line with GDPR and confidentiality regulations. I developed our marketing strategy, determining which channels we should use and how much resources and time to invest in each. I did this using multiple Python libraries within Jupyter Notebooks.</li>
    <li>•	I created, developed, and executed our email marketing campaigns.</li>
    <li>•	I used data collected from several APIs connected to Shopify that describe user interactions to recommend and implement changes to landing pages and the flow of our website which led to an increase in the proportion of orders against website visitors.</li>
    
    <h2>Maths Tutor   Private / MyTutor, 2015 - Present</h2>
    <li>•	I simplify difficult concepts, making them easier to understand for the tutee. I prepare useful and tailored lessons to best suit my pupils' needs and capabilities.</li>
    <li>•	I harness my communication and engagement skills to ensure my tutee-maintained attention for an extended period of time.</li>
    
    <h2>Intrests</h2>
    <li>•	I’m always learning new Technologies. Currently I am improving my knowledge of implementing solutions with OpenShift, AI search algorithms and convolutional neural networks for image recognition.</li>
    <li>•	I have a strong entrepreneurial drive and a keen interest in charity work.</li>
