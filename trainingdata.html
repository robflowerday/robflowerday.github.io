    <h1>Training Data and Train Test Split</h1>
    <p>In the previous lesson we learnt how to train a classifier on <br>
        a dataset and create predictions on new data. In the real world <br>
        however, more often than not, we will not be given a set of data <br>
        to train our model on and a set with which to make predictions. <br>
        Instead we are given one dataset and we have to create these <br>
        datasets from it.<br>
        <br>
        This new datasets are called training sets and holdout or<br>
        testing sets.<br>
        <br>
        To create a these two dataset from a single dataset, we want to <br>
        split our two, with a percentage of our data becoming our <br>
        training set, and the remainder becoming our test set.<br>
        <br>
        Sci-kit-learn has a useful function that can perform this for us.<br>
        train_test_split().<br>
        <br>
        This function takes 2 neccessary arguments, the feauture and <br>
        target data you would like to split, and several optional <br>
        arguments, including the test_size, being the proportion of <br>
        your data that the function uses as data for your test set, <br>
        the train_size, being the same as the test size, but for your <br>
        training set, the random_state, being a seed with which you <br>
        could recreate the data your function produces if you choose <br>
        by passing the same argument, shuffle, which if set to True, <br>
        shuffles your data before performing the split and stratify, <br>
        which will ensure there is the same proportionof each target <br>
        label in the test set and train set as there is in the <br>
        actual data.<br>
        <br>
        The output of train_test_split is 4 values and therefore should <br>
        be unpacked into 4 values, these values are the feature data in <br>
        the training set, the feature data in the test set, the target <br>
        data in the training set and the target data in the test set.<br>
        <br>
        An example of this is given below, importing the iris dataset <br>
        as in the previous lesson.<br>
